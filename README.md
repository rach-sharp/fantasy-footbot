#### To-Do List

* Need to make sure it picks a good captain for your team, since they're worth twice as much.
* Need to make it care less about the value of players on the bench
* Need to implement week-to-week factors such as home/away, strength of opposing team, and have a mode which scouts good transfers rather than for building a team
